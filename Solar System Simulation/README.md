## Controls

Look around the scene by holding right click and moving your mouse. You can zoom the camera in/out by scrolling.

Pressing the **space bar** pauses the scene

Speed up and slow down the playback speed of the scene by pressing the **right arrow** and **left arrow** keys respectively. This doubles/halves the playback speed each time the appropriate key is pressed.

Pressing the **R** key resets the objects back to their original position. This does not reset your pause state, playback speed or camera position.
